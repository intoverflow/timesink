Math and math accessories. A place where I blow off some steam in the [Lean proof assistant](leanprover.github.io).

Tested with Lean Prover [version 3.3.0](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.3.0).


## Contents

* `sep`. Separation algebras. A *separation algebra* is a set `S` together with an operator which maps `S*S` to the power-set of `S`. This operator is assumed to be commutative and (in an appropriate sense) associative. (See [Bringing order to the separation logic jungle](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/bringing-order.pdf), by Cao, Cuellar, Appel.) We explore some of the algebraic properties of these structures.
